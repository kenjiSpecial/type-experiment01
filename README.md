# budo-gulp-react-flux-starter

It is starter kit for  react and flux.


## Usage

```sh


# install dependencies
npm install

# start development server & open browser
npm run open
```

This should run the watch server and open `localhost:9966` in your default browser. Changes to `src/js/index.js` will trigger a incremental bundle and page reload. 

Changes to files in `src/sass/` will cause CSS injection without losing application state. 

Syntax errors are overlayed in the browser with a custom style:
